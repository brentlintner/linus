# **Unified Python Library for Gemini and Claude API Access with Streaming Support**

This report addresses the need for a Python library that allows developers to interact with both Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude large language models (LLMs) while retaining streaming capabilities. The user is currently utilizing the google-genai Python library but seeks a solution that offers a unified interface for these two prominent LLMs, without relying on the Vertex AI API. This analysis evaluates several potential libraries and recommends the most suitable option along with guidance on migrating the existing codebase.

## **Evaluating Potential Multi-LLM Libraries**

Several Python libraries aim to provide a unified interface for interacting with multiple LLM providers. This section examines four such libraries – OpenRouter, LiteLLM, AI4Free, and AISuite – based on their support for Gemini and Claude, streaming capabilities, ease of integration, API key requirements, and other relevant features 1.
**OpenRouter:** This library offers a unified API for accessing various LLMs, including Gemini and Claude, through a single endpoint 1. It can be accessed programmatically via the Apify API using Python 1. OpenRouter also supports integration using the OpenAI API, which might simplify the transition for users familiar with that interface 7. While it likely supports streaming, the documentation primarily focuses on making API calls and managing an API key 1. Using OpenRouter necessitates creating an account and obtaining an API key, and it operates on a credit-based system 1.
**LiteLLM:** This Python SDK and proxy server aims to unify over 100 LLM APIs, including OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), and Google Gemini, under a consistent interface 4. It offers a single completion() function for interacting with various models, simplifying the development process 10. LiteLLM explicitly supports streaming for multiple providers, including Anthropic Claude 4. It also provides features like load balancing, cost tracking, and retry logic, making it suitable for production environments 10. To use LiteLLM, API keys for the respective LLM providers (Gemini and Claude) are required and typically managed as environment variables 4.
**AI4Free:** This library aims to provide free access to a variety of LLMs from different providers, potentially including Gemini and Claude 2. It claims to support multiple providers and offers features like conversation management, prompt optimization, streaming support, and asynchronous capabilities 2. However, its reliance on free tiers or research/demo access might introduce limitations in terms of reliability, availability, and the specific models accessible 2. While it might lower the barrier to entry by not requiring API keys for some models, the level of support and stability for production use cases could be a concern.
**AISuite:** Recently announced, AISuite is an open-source Python library aiming to provide an OpenAI-like API for popular LLMs, including Google and Anthropic 3. The goal is to make it easy to switch between LLM providers by changing a single string 3. While it supports several providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Google, AWS, Groq, Mistral, HuggingFace, and Ollama, it currently does not support streaming 3. This lack of streaming functionality makes it unsuitable for the user's requirement.
Based on this evaluation, **LiteLLM** appears to be the most suitable library for the user's needs. It offers explicit support for both Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude, along with the crucial feature of streaming. Its OpenAI-like interface can ease the transition, and its additional features are beneficial for building robust applications 4.

## **Recommended Library: LiteLLM**

LiteLLM stands out as the recommended library due to its comprehensive support for multiple LLM providers, including the requested Gemini and Claude, and its explicit support for streaming 4. Its design philosophy of providing a unified API, closely mirroring that of OpenAI, simplifies the process of interacting with different LLMs without requiring significant code changes for each provider 4.
**Key Features and Benefits of LiteLLM:**

* **Unified API:** LiteLLM provides a consistent completion() function that works across various LLM providers, including Gemini and Claude 10. This abstraction simplifies the code and reduces the learning curve when working with multiple models.
* **Streaming Support:** The library explicitly supports streaming responses for both Anthropic Claude and, likely, Google Gemini 4. This aligns with the user's requirement to maintain streaming functionality.
* **Wide Range of Provider Support:** Beyond Gemini and Claude, LiteLLM supports over 100 LLM providers, offering flexibility to explore other models in the future 10.
* **Production-Ready Features:** LiteLLM includes features such as load balancing across different deployments, cost tracking for different providers, and automatic retry logic, which are valuable for building and maintaining production-level applications 4.
* **Active Community:** With a significant number of GitHub stars and regular updates, LiteLLM benefits from a strong and active community, ensuring ongoing development, bug fixes, and readily available support 10.

**API Key Management with LiteLLM:**
To utilize Gemini and Claude through LiteLLM, the user will need to obtain API keys from both Google AI Studio for Gemini and the Anthropic console for Claude 11. These API keys are typically configured as environment variables for LiteLLM to access securely 4.

* **Anthropic Claude:** The API key obtained from the Anthropic console should be set as an environment variable named ANTHROPIC\_API\_KEY. This can be done in Python code before making any calls to the Claude models through LiteLLM:
  Python
  `import os`
  `os.environ = "your_anthropic_api_key" # Replace with your actual key`

  (4)
* **Google Gemini:** For accessing Google's Gemini models, the API key is typically generated from Google AI Studio 11. This key should then be set as an environment variable named GOOGLE\_API\_KEY:
  Python
  `import os`
  `os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your_gemini_api_key" # Replace with your actual key`

  While LiteLLM can interact with Gemini models hosted on Vertex AI, the user's preference is to avoid direct Vertex AI usage. By using the Google AI Studio API key and specifying the appropriate Gemini model identifier within LiteLLM (which likely points to the Gemini Developer API), the user should be able to achieve the desired interaction without directly engaging with the Vertex AI SDK.
  * It's crucial for the user to consult the LiteLLM documentation to identify the exact model identifiers that correspond to the Gemini models accessible via the Google AI Studio API key. This will ensure correct usage within the LiteLLM completion function. Different libraries and APIs might use slightly different naming conventions for the same underlying models. The LiteLLM documentation will provide the authoritative mapping between model names and the corresponding backend services.
* **Understanding Model Identifiers in LiteLLM:** When making API calls through LiteLLM, the user will need to specify the desired LLM model using a specific identifier string. For Gemini, this might include identifiers like "gemini-pro" or "gemini-1.5-flash". Similarly, for Claude, identifiers such as "claude-3-sonnet" or "claude-3-opus" might be used. The user should refer to the official LiteLLM documentation (4) for the most up-to-date and accurate list of supported model identifiers for both Gemini and Claude.

## **Code Conversion Examples**

This section provides conceptual examples of how to convert the user's existing google-genai code for streaming with Gemini to LiteLLM and how to implement streaming with Claude using LiteLLM.

* **Conceptual Overview of Current google-genai Streaming:** The user's existing implementation likely involves initializing a Gemini GenerativeModel using their API key and then calling the generate\_content method with the stream=True parameter. The response is then iterated over to process the streamed chunks of text. A simplified representation might look like this:
  Python
  `import google.generativeai as genai`

  `# Assuming API key is configured`
  `model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')`
  `response_stream = model.generate_content("Write a short story about a robot who wants to be a dancer.", stream=True)`

  `for chunk in response_stream:`
      `print(chunk.text, end="", flush=True)`

* **Transitioning to LiteLLM for Gemini Streaming:** To achieve the same streaming functionality for Gemini using LiteLLM, the user will utilize the completion function with the stream=True parameter. The code would resemble the following:
  Python
  `from litellm import completion`
  `import os`

  `# Ensure your Google API key is set as an environment variable:`
  `# os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your_gemini_api_key"`

  `try:`
      `response_stream = completion(`
          `model="gemini-pro", # Or a more specific Gemini model identifier like "gemini-1.5-flash"`
          `messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short story about a robot who wants to be a dancer."}],`
          `stream=True`
      `)`
      `for chunk in response_stream:`
          `print(chunk['choices']['delta'].get('content', ''), end="", flush=True)`
  `except Exception as e:`
      `print(f"An error occurred: {e}")`

  * This example demonstrates how to use LiteLLM's completion function to interact with a Gemini model and receive a streamed response. It's important to note that the structure of the streamed chunks in LiteLLM is different from google-genai. The actual text content is typically found within the choices list, specifically in the delta dictionary under the key content. The .get('content', '') method is used to safely access this content, providing an empty string if it's not present in a particular chunk. The user might need to adjust how they process these chunks based on the specific structure returned by the Gemini model through LiteLLM.
* **Implementing Claude Streaming with LiteLLM:** To use Anthropic's Claude for streaming with LiteLLM, the process is very similar, with the key difference being the model identifier used in the completion function:
  Python
  `from litellm import completion`
  `import os`

  `# Ensure your Anthropic API key is set as an environment variable:`
  `# os.environ = "your_anthropic_api_key"`

  `try:`
      `response_stream = completion(`
          `model="claude-3-sonnet", # Or another Claude model identifier like "claude-3-opus"`
          `messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short story about a robot who wants to be a dancer."}],`
          `stream=True`
      `)`
      `for chunk in response_stream:`
          `print(chunk['choices']['delta'].get('content', ''), end="", flush=True)`
  `except Exception as e:`
      `print(f"An error occurred: {e}")`

  * This code snippet shows how to achieve streaming with a Claude model using LiteLLM. Similar to the Gemini example, it utilizes the completion function with stream=True. The model parameter is set to a Claude-specific identifier. The structure of the streamed response chunks and the way to access the text content (chunk\['choices'\]\['delta'\].get('content', '')) are generally consistent across different LLM providers when using LiteLLM, which is a significant advantage of this unified library.

## **Summary and Next Steps**

By adopting LiteLLM, the user will gain a unified and streamlined approach to working with both Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude models within their Python applications. This transition will allow them to maintain their existing streaming functionality while seamlessly integrating Claude's capabilities. Furthermore, LiteLLM's support for a wide range of other LLM providers offers the flexibility to explore and incorporate additional models in the future without significant code overhauls. The library's production-ready features, such as cost tracking and load balancing, can also be beneficial for building robust and scalable applications.
